        "Augmented is a personal fitness application used to track fitness and nutrition. The end goal for augmented is to have user base (other than myself) use the application to record exercises routines, sleep schedules, meals, etc., connect wearable and smart devices to the application, and access other fitness and diet tracking applications, to have one place to collect all self tracking data. Currently, the application is only used to track cardio workouts."

Keeps code quality standards using ES Lint, compiled using Webpack, and tested using Mocha framework. The UI is deployed to an AWS S3 bucket, which statically hosts the applcation. GoDaddy is used to forward mask any user that navigates to the S3 bucket address.",
        "The back end of the applcation is written in .NET framework, using C# to write the API to perform basic CRUD functions against a database generated using Entity Framework. The API and the database are deployed manually on Azure using Visual Studio."

        "The backend of the application is made using a Java Spring Boot framework built with Apache Maven. The API is used to perform basic CRUD functionality with JSON objects in an S3 bucket (seperate from the statically hosted bucket), that requires authentication for any functionality besides retrieval.",
